===================

Miscellaneous config files and projects I didn't feel merited their own repository.

Projects under this repo:
- hue - C program for managing a PiGlow board on the Raspberry Pi and having it somewhat mimic functionality found in the Philips Hue.
- kbbutil - C program for reading and writing the brightness level of the keyboard backlight in modern Apple MacBooks. See README in this folder for more information.
