Miscellaneous config files and projects I didn't feel merited their own repository.

Projects under this repo:
- hue - C program for managing a PiGlow board on the Raspberry Pi and having it somewhat mimic functionality found in the Philips Hue.

Formerly included in this repo was the `kbbutil` utility, responsible for controlling keyboard brightness. For simplicity's sake, this has been split off into its own repo, https://github.com/MaffC/kbrightnessutil-osx
